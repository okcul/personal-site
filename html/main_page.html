    <p>i'm okcul! you can also call me by the username of whatever discord account i'm using, which might also be okcul! i don't really care about pronouns, to be honest. i'd actually rather have you only refer to me by name if possible, cause for some reason that's way easier. </p>

      <li>i made the discord bot 'Mr. Brett', a bot that pulls from the site thebrpage.net and returns information about the band Bad Religion. this info ranges from their songs to their albums to even pieces of individual merchandise. 'Mr. Brett' was coded in python.</li>
      ‎
      <li>i made this site using html, css, and js! it's kind of ugly, but still, it's something i worked on from the ground up.</li>
      ‎
      <li>i'm currently working on a terraria mod using c#. it'll mostly consist of weapons to fill the gaps between certain bosses, especially some modded bosses. i may also attempt to program a boss with it's own AI, but that'll be in the near future.</li>
